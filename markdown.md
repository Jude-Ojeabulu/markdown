#### Lesson 5 Blockquotes

##### Example 1

I read this interesting quote the other day:

> "Her eyes had called him and his soul had leaped at the call. To live, to err, to fall, to triumph, to recreate life out of life!"

##### Example 2

> Once upon a time and a very good time it was there was a moocow coming down along the road and this moocow that was coming down along the road met a nicens little boy named baby tuckoo...
>
> His father told him that story: his father looked at him through a glass: he had a hairy face.
>
> He was baby tuckoo. The moocow came down the road where Betty Byrne lived: she sold lemon platt.

##### Example 3

> He left her quickly, fearing that her intimacy might turn to jibing and wishing to be out of the way before she offered her ware to another, a tourist from England or a student of Trinity. Grafton Street, along which he walked, prolonged that moment of discouraged poverty. In the roadway at the head of the street a slab was set to the memory of Wolfe Tone and he remembered having been present with his father at its laying. He remembered with bitterness that scene of tawdry tribute. There were four French delegates in a brake and one, a plump smiling young man, held, wedged on a stick, a card on which were printed the words: _VIVE L'IRLANDE_!

#### Lesson 6 Lists

##### Example 5

1. Cut the cheese

Make sure that the cheese is cut into little triangles.

2. Slice the tomatoes

Be careful when holding the knife.

For more help on tomato slicing, see Thomas Jefferson's seminal essay _Tom Ate Those_.

#### Lesson 7 Paragraphs

##### Example 1

We pictured the meek mild creatures where  
They dwelt in their strawy pen,  
Nor did it occur to one of us there  
To doubt they were kneeling then.

##### Example 2

1. Crack three eggs over a bowl.

   Now, you're going to want to crack the eggs in such a way that you don't make a mess.

   If you _do_ make a mess, use a towel to clean it up!

2. Pour a gallon of milk into the bowl.

   Basically, take the same guidance as above: don't be messy, but if you are, clean it up!

## Exercise 2

#### **STANDARD GENERALIZED MARKUP LANGUAGE**

_Standard Generalized Markup Language_ (**SGML**) is a markup language that provides a standard for defining markup languages. It is used for marking up files such that they are no longer dependent on any other application. It uses .sgml extension for saving SGML files. It manipulates massive files which require frequent revisions and is a part of complicated systems.

> It defines the relationship between entities, elements, and attributes of a document and also defines rules that allow the computer system to identify the start and end of an element.

It provides the simplest way to exchange files between machines and applications directly

**Features:**

1. Platform independent
2. Elements marked by different tags
3. Elements have generic types and attributes
4. Consistent use of delimiters and special characters
5. String substitution for standard boilerplate text, and document management.

#### **EXTENSIBLE HYPERTEXT MARKUP LANGUAGE**

_Extensible Hypertext Markup Language_ (**XHTML**) is a markup language that is used to create HTML documents that support custom tags to define new elements. It is more strict than HTML in terms of error handling i.e browser doesnâ€™t display web pages in case of errors in the markup document.

> It creates an **XML** version of the **HTML** document which must be marked up correctly. It specifies some mandatory tags such as <!DOCTYPE>, <html>, <head>, <title>, and <body> that should be present in the document. Also <html> tag should contain xmlns attribute in case of XHTML.

It is necessary to include DTD (Document Type Definition) declaration in XHTML web page. _There are three types of DTD as follows_.

1. Transitional DTD.
2. Frameset DTD
3. Strict DTD
